# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction Web App

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Flask Web Application** that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Malignant (Cancerous)** or **Benign (Non-Cancerous)** based on medical diagnostic features.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **classification model** that can assist doctors and patients by providing quick, data-driven predictions of breast cancer using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.

The web interface allows users to:
- Enter 30 medical feature values (e.g., `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, `concavity_worst`, etc.)
- Get an instant prediction result (Malignant or Benign)
- View predictions with a clean and user-friendly UI
